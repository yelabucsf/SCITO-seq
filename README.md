# SCITO-seq: single-cell combinatorial indexed cytometry sequencing

This repository contains SCITO-seq package for demultiplexing and resolving single cell data from SCITO-seq experiments.
It also contains manuscript-related CyTOF data, SCITO-seq data and code and notebooks used for analysis. 

# News
We are currently working on integrating python SCITO-seq package into the unified workflow.

### Repository structure:
`paper/code` - R code and jupyter notebooks demonstrating SCITO-seq data analysis  
`paper/CyTOF` - CyTOF data  
`paper/SCITOseq_counts` - count matrices (outputs of `cellranger count`)  
`Tutorial.md` - detailed SCITO-seq data analysis workflow as presented in the manuscript
